# WiiMart Website (Fan Version)

a fan-made revival of the classic Wii Shop Channel, built just for fun and nostalgia â€” with a little modern twist :3

**Note:** This is an independent remake and not the official WiiMart site

## ðŸŒŸ about this Project

i created this version of WiiMartâ€™s website simply because i was bored lol. this project was built independently, without any affiliation to the actual WiiMart team

while it started as a fun side project, it's no longer receiving active updates (or maybe just a few scattered ones), as Iâ€™ve shifted focus to other creative things I'm working on ^^

## Check Out the Official Site!

WiiMart has since released a new official website, and I highly recommend checking it out here:

## ðŸ’¾ Usage

feel free to fork this repo if youâ€™d like to play around with it, remix it, or use parts of the code for your own experiments. since im not updating this website anymore
all i ask is that you please credit me somewhere if you do (â‰§â—¡â‰¦)

Happy shopping!
